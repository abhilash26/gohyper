It provides a solid foundation for building web applications using a carefully curated set of technologies.

## Technologies Used

1. **Golang for Backend**
   - A powerful and efficient programming language that facilitates rapid development of scalable and performant backend services.

2. **HTMX for Web Interactivity and Reactivity**
   - A lightweight JavaScript library for creating web applications with minimal JavaScript while enhancing user interactivity and reactivity.

3. **SQLite for Fast, Maintainable, and Embeddable Database**
   - A self-contained, serverless, and zero-configuration database engine that provides a reliable and efficient storage solution for web applications.

4. **Pollen CSS for Better Design Scales Guidelines**
   - A modular and customizable CSS framework that follows design scales to ensure consistency and aesthetics in web application design.

5. **Chi as Fast Web Router**
   - A lightweight and expressive Go router that facilitates the creation of RESTful APIs and routing in web applications.

6. **Air for Watching Go Apps (In Development Mode)**
   - A live-reloading tool for Go applications that enhances the development experience by automatically rebuilding and restarting the application during development.

7. **Gulp for Running and Watching CSS and JS, and Minification**
   - A task runner that automates common development tasks, such as running and watching CSS and JS files, as well as minification for optimized production builds.

8. **Makefile for Faster Execution of Commands**
